# Angular Services Lab

### Objectives

- Build a simple Todos app in Angular
- Refactor the app from `controller as` method to `$scope` method
- Use other core services in the app

## Directions

This is a *pair programming* lab.

**First**, initialize a git repo and build a simple Todos app in Angular using the `controller as` method. Use the Boats App as a resource! Practice git team workflow and make sure you each make at least a couple of commits!

Then take out a new branch called *scope*. **Do not** merge that branch into your master. If you reference the lab later, you will want to still see the `controller as` method, since that's what you'll be using in other labs and projects.

- Add the `$log` service.
- Use this [core services cheatsheet](https://d2eip9sf3oo6c2.cloudfront.net/pdf/egghead-io-angular-core-services-cheat-sheet.pdf) or the [Angular Docs](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide) to find at least one other service to use. If you find one you like, share it with the rest of the class!
